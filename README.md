This is a Quantum computing library in where I am implementing different Quantum 
algorithms to be used in Shor's algorithm using modular exponentiation, 
as desccribed in "Circuit for Shorâ€™s algorithm using 2n+3 qubits" 
by Stephane Beauregard.

The objective of this work is to better understand Quantum Computing foundations
and to get practice with Qiskit, so if you are interested in using the code 
please consider that it could be optimized/improved.

First results can be already obtained using the code, such as the periodicity, 
but I am still working on it
